- test_opsimObsData.dat : small part of opsim 2.168 used by other groups to generate a simlib oldSimlib.simlib
- oldSimlib.simlib : truncated output of simlib file created by DACG 
- enigma_1189_micro.db : sqlite database with the Summary table of the OpSim output to be used for tests. This database has the same format as the enigma_1189_sqlite.db, but has a small selection of visits from the WFD and DDF proposals in part of the first year. This was generated by ./scripts/make_smallOpsim.py and requires setting a path to the enigma_1189 sqlite database. The script can be run without any further dependencies, but the location to 'enigma_1189_sqlite.db must be provided.
- Enigma_1189_micro_main.simlib : This is a simlib file created by ./scripts/make_testsimlib.py . This simlib file has been tested by running the SNANA utility simlib_coadd.exe to produce nightly coadds that have been used in a simulation in `/home/rbiswas/data/SNDATA_ROOT/INTERNAL/LSST/SIMULATIONS/test_microEnigma` using SNANA_v39c. We therefore take the format of the simlib file to be correct, and test that we can reproduce this format.
- healpixels_smicro.db : A healpixelised opsim saved to a sqlite database and created using older script version. We will treat this as the correct version for tests
