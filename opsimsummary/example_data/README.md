- test_opsimObsData.dat : small part of opsim 2.168 used by other groups to generate a simlib oldSimlib.simlib
- oldSimlib.simlib : truncated output of simlib file created by DACG 
- enigma_1189_micro.db : sqlite database with the Summary table of the OpSim output to be used for tests. This database has the same format as the enigma_1189_sqlite.db, but has a small selection of visits from the WFD and DDF proposals in part of the first year. This was generated by ./scripts/make_smallOpsim.py and requires setting a path to the enigma_1189 sqlite database. The script can be run without any further dependencies, but the location to 'enigma_1189_sqlite.db must be provided.
